# How to test SMTP

## MailHog

In the development environment, a [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) container is started alongside odoo.

This service is published by default on http://localhost:8025

The default server environment file configuration for `dev` is configured to use this MailHog container as SMTP server. As soon as Odoo sends an email, it will be trapped in the MailHog server and can be viewed on http://localhost:8025

## Add setup on an existing project

If the container does not exist on this project because it's older than this, you'll need to:

* Add the container in docker-compose.yml
* Add the `server_environment_file` config in the `dev` profile

## MailTrap

In integration and test environment, [mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io) is used.

To create a new account for a project, use the email address that can be found on the specific project page (tab "Other Info") of our Odoo instance and a random password.

The confirmation email of mailtrap.io will appear in the issues of the corresponding project.

Don't forget to add an entry in lastpass.
